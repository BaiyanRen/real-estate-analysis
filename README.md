People who left their hometown and built the career in a new city, like me, would start thinking about settling down at some point. Choose a state, a city, a neighbor, then a life. But, when we are talking about home, what are we talking about? Family, warmth, dogs, cats, and of course, the "home" building on the ground. 

Home is a special product in our life. Its value is dependent on so many factors, including but not limited to, size, neighbor, building material, interest rate, economy. I divide them into three groups: The first one contains the property of the home itself; the second one contains the features of the local area; the third one contains loan interest rates and economical situations, which exibit global impact on the real estate market. 

The state of Texas locates in the south central part of US. It is the second largest state by area or population, however, its life expense is not high. With the trend of remote working, Texas attracts increasing number of people moving in. The population flow, to some extent, influences the local real-estate market. 

Texas is also my future home. It has the same latitude with my hometown, Yunnan. And I love the warm winter.

So, I want to explore the changes in home values in Texas.
