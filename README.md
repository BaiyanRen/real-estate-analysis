People who left their hometown and built the career in a new city, like me, would start thinking about settling down at some point. Choose a state, a city, a neighbor, then a life. But, when we are talking about home, what are we talking about? Family, warmth, dogs, cats, and of course, the "home" building on the ground. 

Home is a special product in our life. Its value is dependent on so many factors, including but not limited to, size, neighbor, building material, interest rate, economy. These factors could be devided into three groups: The first one contains the property of the home itself; the second one contains the features of the local area; the third one contains loan interest rates and economical situations, which exibit global impact on the real estate market.
