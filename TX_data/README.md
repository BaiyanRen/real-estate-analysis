## Data after Wrangling

The original data were cleaned, merged, and modified in the [Data Wrangling notebook](https://github.com/BaiyanRen/real-estate-analysis/blob/main/Home%20Values%20in%20TX_Data%20Wrangling.ipynb). In this directory, I saved all the processed data. The [web application](https://capstone-baiyan.herokuapp.com/) used these data for visualization.

Here are the original data source:
